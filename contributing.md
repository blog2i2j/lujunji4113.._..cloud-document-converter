## Prerequisites

In order to download necessary tools, clone the repository, and install dependencies via pnpm, you need network access.

You'll need the following tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-binaries), x64 or ARM64, version >= 22.6.0

### Development container

Alternatively, you can avoid local dependency installation as this repository includes a **Visual Studio Code [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)** development container.

For Dev Containers, use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume** command which creates a Docker volume for better disk I/O on macOS and Windows.

## Development Setup

You will need Node.js with minimum version as specified in the .node-version file, and PNPM with minimum version as specified in the "packageManager" field in package.json.

After cloning the repo, run:

```shell
$ pnpm i # install the dependencies of the project
```

```shell
cd apps/chrome-extension
pnpm run build --watch # build chrome extension

# pnpm run build --watch --target firefox # build firefox extension
